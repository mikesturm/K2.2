**Purpose** to get awarded the business for 2 parts worth $1 million at Morgan Corp at least a 34% margin.

Scope

## Plan

- [x] Send Karla information to see what kind of better costs we can get from suppliers. (done)

- [x] ^t1^ Create a Cost Savings proposal to push on Antwan, based on VMI & Inventory reduction #P5 #asap
On the Leonids part, it would be within 3 months—as that’s all they’re committed to with their current supplier.  
On the Star part, they have about 7 months of inventory now. So that would be the timeframe. We’d want to avoid them having to reorder from their current supplier.
