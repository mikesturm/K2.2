# Nick's Elster Commission

## Objective: Request a new commission for 2026 for Nick on Elster, based on his work to get a 3-year deal with them.

**Status** Delegated

### Plan

1. Nick to prepare data on expected sales & margin for Elster (in progress)
		-Hurdle: Nick needs to reconcile the landed costs he quoted Elster with vs. what we've been actually buying parts for. There's reason to believe we've been purchasing parts at a higher cost than what Nick quoted based upon (not including tariffs)
2. Mike to review with him and compare scenarios
3. Nick & Mike to agree on what's fair and reasonable to propose to leadership
4. Mike to propose to Gregg

### Argument
1. Most likely scenario w/o a 3-year agreement is retaining 50% of P173 and ??? other business.
2. Worst case scenario is we lose everything.
3. We previously only had the blanket orders for some parts, $1,030,000 (listed on the commission justification)
	1. Nick's commission was based on $2.2mm at a 40% margin.
### Background & Notes:

- Current commission he's getting ($22k for 1 year) is based on 1 year of blanket orders he negotiated
  - Assumptions: $2.2 million in sales 40% margin
- After securing the blankets, he negotiated getting the business for 3 years.
  - this was quoted about $1.2 millioin is at a 34% margin
- Elster future margin (analyzed)
