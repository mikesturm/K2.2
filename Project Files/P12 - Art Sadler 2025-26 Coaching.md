- The speaker thanked the volunteer school registration coordinators for their significant organizational efforts.
- The league's success is attributed to incorporating feedback from coaches over the years.
- The agenda for the meeting is on the report, but the web portion will be skipped.

#### **Uniforms and Player Gear**
- Uniforms are t-shirt based and will be delivered before or after the first game, depending on printing and distribution.
- The goal is to have them available for the first game.
- If a uniform is missing or the wrong size, players should wear a plain jersey of the same color for that week.
- Uniform numbers will follow IHSA or ADA standards.

#### **Website and Communication**
- The league website is the primary source for information: [Artsadler.com](https://artsadler.com) and Artsadler.org
- The "League News" section, which pops up on login, will contain schedule announcements.
- The website includes schedules, standings, rules, forms, and a contact list.
- Coaches must check the website every Thursday for schedule updates or changes.
- Coaches should provide their cell number and email for urgent communications regarding schedule changes.

#### **Scheduling and Game Times**
- The season runs on consecutive weeks from January 10 to February 28.
- Games are primarily played on Saturdays. Sunday games will start at 1:00 PM or later.
- Schedule requests must be submitted via email through the website within two weeks.
- Doubleheaders may occur, especially for teams with schedule requests.
  - There will be a one-hour break for doubleheaders at the same site.
  - There will be a two-hour break for doubleheaders at different sites.

#### **Divisions and Team Structure**
- The league will have a third-grade boys division and a fourth-grade boys division.
- A third-/fourth-grade girls division is being considered, depending on registration numbers.
- Teams can start a game with four players; the opposing team is allowed to play with five.
- Sharing players between teams is generally not allowed for the tournament, except in rare, pre-approved cases.

#### **Game Rules and Regulations**
- **Playing Time:**
  - All players should receive as equal playing time as possible.
  - Players should sit for at least four minutes per half to ensure they get rest.
  - Officials do not track playing time; issues should be reported to the site coordinator, not the opposing coach.
- **Game Format:**
  - Games consist of two 18-minute halves with a running clock.
  - The clock stops on all whistles during the last two minutes of the game.
- **Overtime:**
  - A single two-minute overtime period will be played if the game ends in a tie.
  - The clock stops on all whistles during overtime. If still tied, the game ends as a tie.
- **Pressing:**
  - Pressing is not allowed at any grade level, except during the final two minutes of the game.
  - A restraining line rule is in effect; defenders must fall back until the ball crosses the line. Fast breaks are an exception.
- **Fouls and Free Throws:**
  - Once a team is in the bonus, the opposing team is awarded one point and possession for any subsequent non-shooting foul.
  - This rule is intended to teach players to play defense without fouling.

#### **Grade-Specific Rules**
- **Third Grade:**
  - One coach is allowed on the floor to help players during the first four games.
  - Games may use only one official for the first few weeks.
  - A 27.5-inch basketball is used.
- **Fourth Grade:**
  - Coaches are not allowed on the floor during games.
  - All games will have two officials.
  - A 28.5-inch basketball is used.
- **Mixed Grade Games:** If a third-grade team plays a fourth-grade team, third-grade rules will apply.

#### **Officials' Philosophy and Points of Emphasis**
- Officials (Jeff and Joe) will help teach players the rules during games, sometimes stopping play for instruction.
- Key areas of focus include:
  - Traveling violations and teaching players to establish a pivot foot.
  - Defensive three-second violations are not a point of emphasis.
  - Keeping shirts tucked in.
- Coaches can talk to officials about a struggling player to help them understand the rules.
- Substitutions should be made by checking in at the scorer's table.

#### **Year-End Rewards**
- The league provides year-end rewards instead of participation trophies.
- **Third Grade:** Coaches receive individual trophies to award to players for categories like "Hustler," "Best Ball Handler," "Star Rebounder," and "Most Improved."
- **Fourth Grade:** Players receive custom bag tags with their name, number, and school colors.
- Rewards will be available for pickup at the host site's admission table during the tournament.
