  * **[Erin Sturm](mailto:erinmsturm@gmail.com) (Wife):** We’ve been married for 15 years. I’ve created trust issues with her in the past due to lying about relapses in my substance abuse. I’ve created a wedge between us intimacy-wise due to blaming her for instances of my ED in the past.  
  * **[Norah Sturm](mailto:coreyfroggy@gmail.com) (Daughter):** Born Jun 6, 2014\. She’s a lovely, smart little girl who is growing up so fast. I feel like I need to make more time for her.

# Professional Relationships

These individuals are integral to my career growth, daily work, and professional development, influencing my productivity and motivation in a work context.

* **Manager/Supervisor:**  
  * **Gregg Cox:** My direct manager. His feedback and direction are crucial for my task prioritization and career path within the organization.  
* **Colleagues/Team Members:**  
  * **Brad Derry (Team Lead):** A key collaborator and long-time friend. He’s my peer on the Sales Team (along with Curt  
  * **Curt McCullough (Team Lead):** Peer to me, leads a few of the sales reps I used to lead. We have a decent relationship, but I’ve heard he’s not a straight-shooter. He handles contracts at Field.  
  * The FWC (Field Wrecking Crew): The coworkers below are all part of a team that was the first of its kind at Field in 2023-2024. We were   
    * **Jake Schmidt \- Director of Customer Experience**  
    * **Tony Ellis \- Director of Ops**  
    * **Rich Rowlett \- General Manager (Florence, SC branch)**  
    * **Ryan Dickerson \- Director of Finance & Innovation:** Ryan and I have had an interesting journey. There was a time where he was very critical of me for not taking seriously his concerns about Honeywell past due invoices. It came to a head in 2024\. But after talking with him, we did a monumental “clearing” exercise in front of the FWC group and the consultants in Boulder, CO during our trip there in 2024\. Ryan gained respect for me, and we began building trust. Things have generally been good since then.  
  * **Melissa Patel \- VP of Supply Chain**  
* **My Team**   
  This is the team I have direct responsibility for. I should be pushing them to meet their objectives, coaching them to improve, mentoring them, and removing roadblocks, so they can succeed.  
  * **Nick Cook**  
  * **Kyle Runte**  
  * **Bryce Ator**  
  * **Dave Wojnicki**  
* **Key Customer Contacts:**  
  * **Antwan Boules \-** Category Lead at JBPCO, the parent company of Morgan Truck Body (aka Morgan Corp) and Morgan Olson. He’s been a continuing source of good business opportunities for Field and for me—where the deals he helps Field get go directly to my commission.  
  * **Evan Kutz \-** Director of procurement for Morgan Truck Body. He’s a funny, authentic (mostly), results-driven, and no-nonsense. I need to make sure I shoot straight with him all the time.  
  * **Josh Lukasak** \- Director of Strategic Sourcing at Honeywell. He seems like a good guy who wants us our 2 companies to have a good partnership. I should keep in touch with him periodically.  
* **Mentors/Industry Contacts:**  
  * **Jen Zahari (Professional Mentor):** An experienced salesperson and lifecoach I can always count on to listen and help.

Understanding these relationships will provide the coach with a holistic view of my support systems and potential influences on my productivity and motivation.
