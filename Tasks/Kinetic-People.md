## @BryceAtor
- Meeting with @BryceAtor @2025-11-19
	- He says we shut Vanguard down again on a VMI part last Wednesday. He says Jake told Jaret to put in an issue for it.
	- Super ATV
		- Gregg called Bryce last week saying we need to have Jake on the internal call about Super ATV source directed components, even though we know basically nothing yet
			- We got costs from Super ATV for these components. We put a margin on the components and then added margin on the cost to kit
			- Super ATV says our kit pricing is good if we DON'T add a margin on the cost Super ATV pays for the components.
	- North American Lighting (Prospect)
		- Spend is $8-10 million. 3 sites in IL, 1 in MS
		- They're open to considering us.
		- Was in Bryce's name, so that fits.
		- Sounds like primarily make-to-print parts
		- They want us to quote a few parts to gage competitiveness
		- I told Bryce to proceed
- Meeting with @JakeSchmidt and @BryceAtor on SuperATV sourced components costing @2025-11-19
	- we decided to wait until we know more about kit costs (many components still high due to low volume initially quoted.)

## @Jarod
- Meeting with @Kyle and @Jarod on Rail Surcharges @2025-11-21
	- Locked Customers - we have to honor pricing
		- Trinity
		- Eagle
		- AITX (though we can get increases through)
	- Trinity Surcharge structure
		- we can update pricing every year
		- The Material, Currency Exchange, and Freight Surcharge is
			- Calculated from a baseline of Oct. 2020 index values
		- Tariff Surcharge
			- Been in place since well before Kyle, so it's not a TARIFF Surcharge, more of an overall import surcharge. It's 8%
	- We looked at Trinity's surcharge spreadsheet and the material index calculations are incorrect and seem to be causing extremely high surcharges that we shouldn't have been charging.
