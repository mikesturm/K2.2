## tomorrow (2) #tomorrow

- [ ] ^t16^ Use Boltwise to quote the 2 Morgan parts #P5 and give feedback to @Karla #tomorrow
     - Evaluation for Karla:
          - Both parts were immediately recognized by Boltwise from ONLY Morgan's part number.
          - Costs weren't correct to her quote to me, but matched P21. 
          - No supplier, though.
          - When I clicked "Find supplier items" button, it clearly did a search...but it lasted for well over a minute with bars just scrolling...
          - When I clicked "View Item Details", I could see the price and all that, but couldn't change it.
