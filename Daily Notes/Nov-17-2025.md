## Capture
- [x] ^t6^ Ask Jake if an issue got entered for the Vanguard shutdown from last week. For @BryceAtor #today
## Notes
- Commitment to @Erin: no masturbation for 30 days (starting 11/14/25) and she'll...y'know.
- Meeting with @BryceAtor
	- He says we shut Vanguard down again on a VMI part last Wednesday. He says Jake told Jaret to put in an issue for it.
	- Super ATV
		- Gregg called Bryce last week saying we need to have Jake on the internal call about Super ATV source directed components, even though we know basically nothing yet
			- We got costs from Super ATV for these components. We put a margin on the components and then added margin on the cost to kit
			- Super ATV says our kit pricing is good if we DON'T add a margin on the cost Super ATV pays for the components.
	- North American Lighting (Prospect)
		- Spend is $8-10 million. 3 sites in IL, 1 in MS
		- They're open to considering us.
		- Was in Bryce's name, so that fits.
		- Sounds like primarily make-to-print parts
		- They want us to quote a few parts to gage competitiveness
		- I told Bryce to proceed 
- Meeting with @JakeSchmidt and @BryceAtor on SuperATV sourced components costing
	- we decided to wait until we know more about kit costs (many components still high due to low volume initially quoted.)
- Sales Huddle 
	- I relayed the message on Round 2 Tariff Increases
	- @Gregg wasn't there
- Date with @Erin
	- Dropped kids off at Honnonegah for rehearsal (tech week)
	- We went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner. It was pretty good.
	- We went to Hard Rock Casino after and spent $140 playing the slots for an hour and a half or so.
	- It was a good time. I was present. Erin enjoyed it.
