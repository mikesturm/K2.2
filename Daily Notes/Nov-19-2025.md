## Notes

- Call with Otis on Round 2 tariffs
	- New proposed surcharge increase is 3.4%
		- Otis expects us to "split the pain", so we need to advise that with this increase, we already did.
	- Otis needs to roll the tariff impact into the piece price
	- After a lot of discussion on how complex piece price tracking for changes would be, we agreed on a delay for changing in the future if tariffs change.
	- Shelley says: their deadline is Dec. 1st
		- Deadline for her to get prices updated is Dec 12th, but she needs a couple days to do it internally.
	- Requested Deliverable:
		- Updated prices down to subcomponents
- Prep for Elkay call
	- We have, on average, $300k of cost on hand.
	- That would be a $416k in sell
- Call with Elkay
	-
