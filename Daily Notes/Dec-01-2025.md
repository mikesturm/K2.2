## Notes

-  Meeting with @BryceAtor
	- Batesville Casket probably isn't expecting VMI
	- Bryce isn't clear on Batesville's Sourcing strategy: do they split off parts or stick with one supplier?
- Meeting on Bonded Warehousing and 3PL
	- The hang-up with SKU was the import/export process into & out of their facility
	- RIM needs to handle import/export for us
	- John is now getting SKU & RIM together as soon as he can
	- Jake says he needs to get an understanding of the 3PL transition project needs to look like before he invests in it
	- Tony committed to having more information & substantive update "within a week"
